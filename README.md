# StaffingSheet Repository


### Introduction 

Project Overview
This should be a simple staffing sheet that is significantly more convieneant and comfortable for most user to use. This should also cover all the limitations in from the previous staffing sheets. This staffing sheet should be light weight and easy to use. It should introduce more "slice of life" featuers that make daily usage of this application easier. 

Pages:

1. THe main page should be the page where you can get to everywhere from. The page will be made simple with a way to get to these pages: Create Team, Create Board, and resume
2. Create team will allow a user to start a team. The team will then heave a team leader(the user). The team leader can set up 'boards' which will essentially be a virtual representation of the combination of the lines of each department.
    - After they add a line into the board they will have the option to either add people to the 'line' or add stations on too the line. Then they can add people into those stations or add 'substations' which breaks down one spot for two people.
3. Create Board will simply allow the user to set up a board without having to start a team. 
    - Board will work like regular but the board is not designed to save information. Users will simply have barcode/name only.
